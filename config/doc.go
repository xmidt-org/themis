// Package config supplies a simple workflow for initializing an uber/fx App instance with spf13/pflag, spf13/viper, and any
// other components that need to be initialized prior to any uber/fx providers running.  Additionally, this package provides
// simpler providers for use by applications that do not need this more complex workflow.
